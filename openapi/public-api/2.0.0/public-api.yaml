  description: "The public API of the Data Plane is a data proxy enabling a data consumer\
    \ to actively querydata from the provider data source (e.g. backend Rest API,\
    \ internal database...) through its Data Planeinstance. Thus the Data Plane is\
    \ the only entry/output door for the data, which avoids the provider to exposedirectly\
    \ its data externally.The Data Plane public API being a proxy, it supports all\
    \ verbs (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), whichcan then conveyed until the\
    \ data source is required. This is especially useful when the actual data sourceis\
    \ a Rest API itself.In the same manner, any set of arbitrary query parameters,\
    \ path parameters and request body are supported (in the limits fixed by the HTTP\
    \ server) and can also conveyed to the actual data source."
