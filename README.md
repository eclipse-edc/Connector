## Documentation

Base documentation can be found on the [documentation website](https://eclipse-edc.github.io). \
Developer documentation can be found under [docs/developer](docs/developer), \
where the main concepts and decisions are captured as [decision records](docs/developer/decision-records/README.md).

## Directory structure

### `spi`

This is the primary extension point for the connector. It contains all necessary interfaces that need to be implemented
as well as essential model classes and enums. Basically, the `spi` modules defines the extent to what users can
customize and extend the code.

### `core`

Contains all absolutely essential building that is necessary to run a connector such as `TransferProcessManager`,
`ProvisionManager`, `DataFlowManager`, various model classes, the protocol engine and the policy piece. While it is
possible to build a connector with just the code from the `core` module, it will have very limited capabilities to
communicate and to interact with a data space.

### `extensions`

This contains code that extends the connector's core functionality with technology- or cloud-provider-specific code. For
example a transfer process store based on Azure CosmosDB, a secure vault based on Azure KeyVault, etc. This is where
technology- and cloud-specific implementations should go.

If someone were to create a configuration service based on Postgres, then the implementation should go into
the `extensions/database/configuration-postgres` module.

### `launchers`

Launchers are essentially connector packages that are runnable. What modules get included in the build (and thus: what
capabilities a connector has) is defined by the `build.gradle.kts` file inside the launcher subdirectory. That's also
where a Java class containing a `main` method should go. We will call that class a "runtime" and in order for the
connector to become operational the `runtime` needs to perform several important tasks (="bootstrapping"). For an
example take a look at
[this runtime](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Samples/tree/main/basic/basic-01-basic-connector).

### `data-protocols`

Contains implementations for communication protocols a connector might use, such as DSP.
