# Security Policy

Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) follows the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php). Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the EDC project lead. Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the EDC project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team. 

## Supported Versions

Eclipse Dataspace Connector supports security updates for the following releases:

We will maintain the list of supported versions here starting from the first release

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the EDC public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team directly via security@eclipse.org.
