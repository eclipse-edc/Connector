/**
 * Represents a system running on behalf of a dataspace participant.
 * <p>
 * A ParticipantAgent is not the same as a Participant since the former may have claims and attributes that are distinct from the latter. For example, the Acme organization may
 * have connector systems deployed in different geographical regions. While Acme may possess the claim/attribute Partner=GOLD, only the connector running in the EU will have the
 * claim Region=EU.
 * <p>
 * Claims are verifiable claims presented to the current runtime by the ParticipantAgent system, typically as part of a security token or credential store. Attributes are
 * additional values added by the current system based on.
 * <p>
 * Participant agents must have an {@link #PARTICIPANT_IDENTITY} attribute set. The value of the attribute is determined using a dataspace-specific mechanism, but it must be from
 * a trusted source since the value is used to authorize operations such as contract negotiations and data transfers. For example, the identity value may be based on a claim token
 * or a check against a trusted service. The default behavior is to set the identity using the <code>client_id</code> claim, if present. This behavior can be overridden by using a
 * {@link ParticipantAgentServiceExtension}.
